# Matthew Kerr | Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm thrilled to have you here. I'm passionate about writing Java code, constantly expanding my skill set, and exploring the world of design.

ðŸŽ“ Currently, I'm pursuing studies in industrial design, media design, and computer science. Additionally, I proudly serve as a computer science tutor at Victoria University of Wellington. 

ðŸš€ Within my repositories, you'll find an exciting collection of projects and contributions. I enjoy blending my design knowledge with programming to craft innovative solutions. 

âœ¨ At the moment I'm working on my personal portfolio website, and immersing myself in the world of Unreal Engine. Stay tuned for updates!
